#  AI Math Tutor

AI Math Tutor is an educational tool developed by **Aakalanka Liyanage (M23W7266)** that uses a lightweight generative AI model—**DistilGPT-2**—to help students understand and solve math problems through clear, step-by-step explanations. The project is built using **Gradio** for an interactive web interface and is designed to be run locally or in **Google Colab**.

##  Project Objective

To provide students with a simple, AI-driven assistant that explains math solutions rather than just giving the answer—promoting learning and understanding.

##  Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Hugging Face Transformers (DistilGPT-2)
- Gradio (for the user interface)
- Google Colab (optional execution environment)

##  Features

- Interprets math questions written in natural language
- Generates step-by-step reasoning for problems
- Clean and interactive interface using Gradio
- Suitable for beginner to intermediate level math (algebra, calculus basics, etc.)

##  Installation & Running Locally

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Math-Tutor.git

# Navigate to the project folder
cd AI-Math-Tutor

# Install required libraries
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the app
python app.py
```

##  Example Prompts

> Solve for x: 3x - 5 = 10  
>  
> What is the derivative of x²?  
>  
> Explain the Pythagorean theorem

##  Run in Google Colab

You can also run this project in [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/) by uploading the files and executing them in cells.
