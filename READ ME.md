# 🤖 AI Math Tutor

AI Math Tutor is an educational tool developed by **Aakalanka Liyanage (M23W7266)** that uses a lightweight generative AI model—**DistilGPT-2**—to help students understand and solve math problems through clear, step-by-step explanations. The project is built using **Gradio** for an interactive web interface and is designed to be run locally or in **Google Colab**.
